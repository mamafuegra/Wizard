### Files Created/Modified:

1. **`cmds/spotify.py`** - Main Spotify integration module
2. **`spotify_config.json`** - Configuration file for Spotify app settings
3. **`spotify_tokens.json`** - User authentication tokens storage
4. **`requirements.txt`** - Updated with Spotify dependencies
5. **`main.py`** - Modified to load the Spotify module
6. **`SPOTIFY_SETUP.md`** - Comprehensive setup guide

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### Core Spotify Commands:
- `!spotify login` - Connect Spotify account
- `!spotify auth <code>` - Complete authentication

## üìã Setup Requirements

### 1. Spotify Developer Account:
- Create app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Get Client ID and Client Secret
- Set redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback`

### 2. Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback
```

### 3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ How It Works

### For Users:
1. **First Time Setup:**
   - User types `!spotify login`
   - Bot provides authorization link
   - User clicks link and authorizes
   - User copies code and types `!spotify auth <code>`
   - Account is now connected!

2. **Using Auto-Play:**
   - User types `play welcome` (or any song name)
   - Bot automatically searches and plays on their Spotify
   - Works with any device where Spotify is open (web, desktop, mobile)

3. **Full Control:**
   - All standard Spotify commands available
   - Volume control, shuffle, repeat, etc.
   - Like/unlike songs
   - Queue management

### Technical Implementation:
- Uses Spotify Web API for all functionality
- Secure token storage in JSON files
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Error handling for all API calls
- Non-blocking async operations

## üîß Configuration Options

The bot supports both environment variables and manual configuration:

### Environment Variables (Recommended):
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`

### Manual Configuration:
Edit `spotify_config.json` with your Spotify app credentials.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- User tokens stored securely
- OAuth2 authentication flow
- No sensitive data in code
- Easy token revocation
- Proper error handling

## üéØ Auto-Play Triggers

The bot listens for these patterns (case-insensitive):
- `play <song>`
- `music <song>`
- `song <song>`
- `listen to <song>`
- `put on <song>`
- `start <song>`
- `queue <song>`
- `add <song>`
- `search <song>`

## üì± Device Compatibility

Works with any device where Spotify is active:
- Spotify Web Player
- Spotify Desktop App
- Spotify Mobile App
- Spotify on smart devices

## üöÄ Ready to Use

The integration is complete and ready to use! Just follow the setup guide in `SPOTIFY_SETUP.md` to:

1. Create your Spotify app
2. Configure environment variables
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the bot

Users will be able to connect their Spotify accounts and enjoy seamless music control through Discord commands and auto-play functionality, just like the bleed bot!

## üéµ Example Usage

```
User: play welcome
Bot: üéµ Now Playing - Welcome by [Artist] - Time to cast some musical spells!

User: music bohemian rhapsody
Bot: üéµ Now Playing - Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen - Let me work my magic on your Spotify!

User: !spotify pause
Bot: ‚è∏Ô∏è Paused - Music playback has been paused.
```

The integration maintains the wizard theme while providing powerful Spotify functionality that works exactly like the bleed bot you referenced!
